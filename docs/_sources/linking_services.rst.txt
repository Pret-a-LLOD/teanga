Linking Services
======

.. currentmodule:: teanga-workflow

The different linking services linked here have been developed to work both as stand-alone components or interacting with other Prêt-à-LLOD components in an NLP workflow.
To that end, they have been developed as Docker components compatible with Teanga (see deliverable D3.5).
This will allow seamless interaction between the Prêt-à-LLOD Transformation, Prêt-à-LLOD Link, and Prêt-à-LLOD Workflow components.
